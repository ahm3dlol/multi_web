         <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The Cleric Beast is a huge creature with hideous, twisted horns, matted fur and a malnourished figure, and emits shrieks that sound like cries of agony. Although at first glance the Cleric Beast appears to have an emaciated and almost skeletal body, this monster has high agility, supernatural strength and a sizable amount of health. It is one of the first bosses encountered in the game, and the first boss to be revealed during the game's development.

    <h2>Strats</h2>
    <p>The Cleric Beast, like many other Beast enemies, is weak to both Fire and Serration damage; this allows the player to take advantage of the Molotov Cocktails in the area, as well as causing two of the three starting weapons to work well against it. The Cleric Beast can be brought to its knees by damaging its face, allowing a Visceral Attack. This can be done by tossing Molotov Cocktails or several shots with a firearm. After staggering the Cleric Beast through this method, the player must wait until it heals its limbs, which is seen by a short animation where a dull red glow briefly engulfs the Cleric Beast's chest.
