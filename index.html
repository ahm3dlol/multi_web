        <p class="Data">Bloodborne follows the player's character, a Hunter, through the decrepit Gothic, Victorian-eraâ€“inspired city of Yharnam, whose inhabitants are afflicted with a blood-borne disease. Attempting to find the source of the plague, the player's character unravels the city's mysteries while fighting beasts and cosmic beings.</p>

        <p>Classes or Origins in Bloodborne are somewhat different from previous Souls games. Instead of the traditional Classes, the character creator provides an "Origin" section, where you choose an origin with a short back-story and starting stats, and some Blood Echoes to go along with it.
